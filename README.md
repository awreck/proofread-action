## Limitations
- ‚ùå Only supports markdown files (will add non-markdown support once #27 gets enough upvotes)
- ‚ùå Only supports the `en-US` language/locale (will add non-English and en-UK support once #28 gets enough upvotes)
- ‚ùå Affected by the [LanguageTool API Limitations](https://dev.languagetool.org/public-http-api) (will find a way to get over this once #29 gets enough upvotes)

## How It Works
Proofread PRs uses the [LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org/proofreading-api) API. This is an amazing API services that provides AI-assisted grammar and spelling corrections for free through an *unauthenticated* API endpoint. Go show [them](https://languagetool.org/) some love ‚ù§Ô∏è
